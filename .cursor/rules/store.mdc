# Store Directory

The [`src/store/`](mdc:src/store) directory contains state management logic for the application. It includes:

- Store modules for different features or domains (in `modules/`)
- Central store exports (`index.ts`)


Use this directory for MobX stores or other state management solutions to manage global or shared application state.
